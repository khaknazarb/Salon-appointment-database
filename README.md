# Salon-appointment-database

This repositry contains the salon.sh and salon.sql files.
The idea of the salon.sh is to help insert the data into database.
The salon.sql is the dump of the "salon" database file to recreate it on the shell.
The database contains the four tables such as customers, services and appointments.
The services table has list of services the salon offers with their service_id.

The salon.sh welcomes the potential customers and then asks to choose service.
Then if customer chooses available service id script asks for the phone number of the customer 
as phone number can uniquly identify the customer. If customer is not on customers table list
script asks for the name of the customer and makes an insert into the database.
After all script asks for the time of appointment and make an insertion into database all the 
information. 

This exercise was done as a mandatory practice exercise from freecodecamp Relational Database course.
Due to course's task requirements the script is not full and meets the minimum requirements of the 
course task. It can be improved and developed more such as adding "cancel appointment","appointment table"
options.

P.S. Thank you for freecodecamp for providing oportunity to learn and study new skills for free.
